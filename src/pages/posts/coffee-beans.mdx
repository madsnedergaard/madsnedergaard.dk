While coffee equipment matters, it's the beans that make the coffee. And beans are not just beans.

This post documents my ongoing quest to find **the best freshly roasted coffee beans** that are
**sold online in Denmark** and are **produced in a sustainable way** at **a fair price**.

After getting our own espresso machine a year ago, I quickly jumped down the rabbit hole of finding
the optimal beans that hit that sweet spot of being both tasty, sustainable and not too expensive.

While I'm in no way an expert on coffee, I have decided to share my experience here in the hope that
it might help others.

Did I miss something, or do you have a different experience with any of these? Please let me know!
