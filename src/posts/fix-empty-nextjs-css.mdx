title: 'Fixing empty NextJS CSS on production builds'

This is a weird one, but while redesigning this page and upgrading to Tailwind 4 + NextJS 15, I had
an issue where the CSS was empty on production builds.

It works fine with both local dev-mode and when building locally.

### Solution

This is a hacky workaround, but it works ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

1. Create an empty CSS file: `touch dummy.css`
2. Import it at the top of the `globals.css` file:

```css
@import './dummy.css';
@import 'tailwindcss';
```
