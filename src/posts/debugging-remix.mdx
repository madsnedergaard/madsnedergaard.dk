This is how to get a great debugging setup with Remix that supports both server-side and client-side
debugging in your editor.

## Workflow

1. open project in your editor
2. Run "start debugging" (shortcut or via command panel)

And that's it! You now have a dev server running in editor terminal and Chrome launching a browser
for running the app. Now you can add breakpoints and figure out why that pesky bug is happening!

## Setting it up

Just add this launch configuration
([inspired by NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/debugging)) as `./vscode/launch.json` in
the root of your project:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Remix: debug full stack",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/server.mjs",
      "runtimeArgs": ["--inspect"],
      "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**", "**/node_modules/**"],
      "serverReadyAction": {
        "action": "debugWithChrome",
        "killOnServerStop": true,
        "pattern": "Express server listening at (https?://.+)",
        "uriFormat": "%s",
        "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/app"
      },
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
