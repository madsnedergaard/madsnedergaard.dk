A brief history of editors I've used since I wrote my first line of code:

- Cursor (2024+)
- VSCode (mid 2010s)
- Sublime Text (early 2010s)
- Notepad++ (late 2000s)
- Notepad (late 2000s)
- [Stone's WebWriter](https://danskedosklassikere.blogspot.com/2022/02/stones-webwriter.html) (early
  2000s)
