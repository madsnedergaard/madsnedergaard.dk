The content on this website is written by me. **Zero LLMs were involved in the writing.** You can
tell English is not my primary language, and there will definitely be typos and mistakes. But you
know what? **That's okay** ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

## Why though?

It might seem somewhat ironic as I'm a heavy user of AI during my work as a software engineer. There
will probably be entire posts about working with LLMs writing code.

But that is work. And _this is not._

I started this blog - or to be honest, rewrote it for the fifth time certain I would get past
‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù this time - with the purpose of improving my communication skills, sharing my
thoughts in public and to learn. Productivity and SEO-friendly walls of text is the anti-goal.

Secondly, the internet is getting flooded with content created by GenAI - and to me it's losing the
human feel. The imperfections and the flaws that made it real ü•≤

It's not that I naively think my tiny collection of words are going to make any difference, but it
feels nice to at least offer an alternative to whoever stumbles upon this.

So enjoy (or don't).
